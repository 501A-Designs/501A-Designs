I had the opportunity to design banner visuals and a user interface for Santa Clara Universities Discord Network. The user interface design was for the groups self maintained Oauth system. The completed UI has a dark & light mode in which users can toggle. The file structure also enables the UI to be themable, in which other developers from different universities can copy the repository and manage a discord oauth system for their schools.
