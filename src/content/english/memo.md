## What I keep in mind when designing
When I design websites and graphics, ~~although at times I dont follow my own guidelines~~ there are a few things I try to keep in mind.

- Consistency
- Functional and scalable design
- Meaningful
- Responsive

### Consistency
Consistency is a necessary element to ensure that users can easily navigate the site, as in UI design there are functional aspects you must consider that are often not considered in logo and poster designs. However, while a strong brand identity is important, too much consistency can make everything look similar and conversely difficult to use, so I think it is important to identify what requires consistancy and vice versa.

### Functional and scalable design
This may not apply to graphic design by itself, but I often think that it is difficult to find a balance between what you want to create and what you can create, especially when developing web services and designing the frontend. (What you want to create is what the mockup looks like on Figma, and what you can create is the actual mockup that has been created through code).
When it comes to code, I often find that the mockup designed in Figma is not optimal because it is difficult to make it into a realistic component, or because of performance degradation, etc., and the final product is often far from what is ideal. In short, this "ideal" and "execution" are not the same thing.

In short, I believe that the balance between "ideal" and "execution" is particularly important.

| Ideal | Reality |
| ------- | ------- |
| Add texture to surfaces | Poor performance |
| Adopting a unique design | Difficult to make into a component and scale vertically |
...etc. There are many things we want to create, but it is difficult to find a balance between what is realistically feasible and what is not.

Therefore, I find it very important to keep this kind of realism in mind to some extent when designing. (I often times just transfer what I have in my head directly into code without using Figma.)

### Meaningful
I don't believe that something that just looks beautiful is meaningless. I want to design with an eye to what kind of ingenuity can be achieved to capture beauty (I feel a kind of self-satisfaction through this).

### Responsive
I believe that responsive design is essential so that the interface is accesible in any aspect ratio. I also think it is important to use responsive design when crafting logos, as it lets the logo adapt to any situation (profile photos, banner images, etc...)
