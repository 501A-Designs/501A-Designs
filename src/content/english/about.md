# Hi

I'm 501A, a designer and developer from Japan.

I am currently in my 1st year at [Santa Clara University](https://scu.edu) majoring in Web Design & Engineering. This website is just a small place for me to organize all of the projects I have worked on in the past, as well as to introduce myself.

I like to craft web applications specifically emphasizing on minimal and thoughtful user experiences. I often use Next.JS as my go to framework, but depending on how I feel I sometimes use Svelte (*this site is built using SvelteKit). As for styling solutions, I also like to use Stitches.JS in combination with Radix UI + Radix Color. I like to use the tools that are the closest to CSS as I can fine tune my designs with more fidelity.
 
During my free time I work on alot of personal projects like [Deizu](https://deizu.vercel.app/) and SEIRYO GROUND both apps targeted for Japanese people. I also post UI and UX ideas on Twitter and Layers as a part of an activity I call UI HIGHLIGHTS (in the near future I would like to create a site of its own).

Aside from technology, I'm also interested in branding and fashion aesthetics.
