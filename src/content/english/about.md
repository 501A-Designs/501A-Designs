# Hi

I'm 501A, a designer and developer from Japan.

I am currently in my 2nd year at [Santa Clara University](https://scu.edu) majoring in Web Design & Engineering. This website is just a small place for me to organize all of the projects I have worked on in the past, as well as to introduce myself.

I like to craft web applications specifically emphasizing on minimal and thoughtful user experiences. I often use Next.JS as my go to framework, but depending on how I feel I sometimes use Svelte (\*this site is built using SvelteKit). As for styling solutions, I like to use Tailwind CSS in combination with Radix UI.

During my free time I work on alot of personal projects like [Deizu](https://deizu.vercel.app/) and SEIRYO GROUND both apps targeted for Japanese people. I also plan to create a site that contains some UI and UX ideas called UI HIGHLIGHTS. Currently I am just posting them on twitter however, in the near future I would like to create a site of its own.

Aside from technology, I'm also interested in branding and fashion, more specifically thinking about its creator and their certain aesthetic as well as brainstorming what pieces they may have been influenced by.

As for styling solutions, I also like to use Stitches.JS in combination with Radix UI + Radix Color. I like to use the tools that are the closest to CSS as I can fine tune my designs with more fidelity.
